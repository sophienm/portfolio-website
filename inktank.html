            <p>Create a web application that provides inspiration for tattoo designs while helping people make informed decisions they won‘t regret. How can I help people find their future tattoo they will be proud of? What do they need to know?
              And how can I help match people with a tattoo artist that fits their style and personality?</p>

            <h3>POSSIBLE PROBLEMS</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>People are often not informed enough about what getting a tattoo implies, e.g. pain, aftercare, etc. Pain is a factor that can often lead to unfinished tattoos.</li>
              <li>Finding the right artist in a specific location can be difficult.</li>
              <li>For some people it is not as simple as just getting a tattoo. They want to establish a connection with the artist to make sure they can trust them. </li>
              <li>People want advice and not just an artist to simply execute a tattoo.</li>

            <h3>POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Allow people to search for artists/studios by style and location.</li>
              <li>Create a messenger feature that will allow people to communicate with an artist directly and help establish trust.</li>
              <li>Provide information all around getting a tattoo in form of articles/instructions so people know what they are doing.</li>

        <h2>OBSERVE</h2>
        <p>To gain insight on the subject I conducted a competitor analysis, a survey and multiple interviews.</p>
        <h3>RESEARCH GOALS</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Determining how users find tattoo inspiration and artists.</li>
          <li>Documenting pain points users have finding inspiration and artists.</li>
          <li>Understanding how much importance the user gives to research before getting a tattoo.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By creating an affinity map I was able to organise and narrow down my users’ goals and frustrations.</p>

        <p>It was surprising to me that none of my interviewees really had issues finding inspiration for tattoos, but that their main pain points were finding the right artist and enough information to feel comfortable with their choices.</p>

        <h2>POINT OF VIEW</h2>

    <div id="inktank_colour_6">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>IDEATE</h2>
        <p>It had become clear to me that I needed to focus on providing my users with helpful information related to getting a tattoo and assist them in finding and creating a connection with an artist. So I decided to concentrate on creating user
          flows for the following features: finding an artist/helpful information, saving an artist, messaging an artist, as well a sign up/log in process.</p>
        <h3>USER FLOW</h3>
        <h4>FIND + SAVE ARTIST</h4>
        <a class="picture_link" href="files/user_flow.jpg" target="_blank">
        <picture class="user_flow">
            <source srcset="img/project_inktank/user_flow@1x.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">
            <img src="img/project_inktank/user_flow@2x.jpg" alt="User flow">
        </picture>
        </a>
        <p>After working on my user flows the next step was to create a sitemap that would help me during the prototyping process. I started off by creating a first sitemap based on my assumptions and the users’ needs I discovered during my
          interviews. And then I refined my sitemap based on the data I had gotten from conducting an open card sort with 7 volunteers. The results helped me gain confidence in some of my assumptions, but also proved some of them wrong.</p>
        <h3>CARD SORT</h3>

        <h3>SITEMAP</h3>

    <div id="inktank_colour_7">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>PROTOTYPE</h2>
        <p>Based on my user flows and my sitemap I started to do quick sketches that resulted in my low-fidelity paper prototype. This helped me gain a rough idea of all the information I needed in each wireframe and where to place it. Below you
          can see one of the user flows translated into low-fidelity sketches.</p>
        <h3>LOW-FIDELITY</h3>
        <h4>SEARCH + SAVE</h4>
<a href="files/low_fidelity.pdf" target="_blank">
        <picture>
            <source srcset="img/project_inktank/low_fidelity@1x.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
            <img src="img/project_inktank/low_fidelity@2x.png" alt="Low-fidelity prototype">
        </picture>
        </a>
        <p>After reviewing my low-fidelity wireframes I continued to translate them into mid-fidelity wireframes using Balsamiq. Only few changes happened from the low fidelity to the mid fidelity prototype. The main change was the addition of the
          onboarding within the sign up flow.</p>
        <h3>MID-FIDELITY</h3>
        <picture>
          <source srcset="img/project_inktank/mid_fidelity@1x.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
          <img src="img/project_inktank/mid_fidelity@2x.png" alt="Mid-fidelity prototype">
        </picture>
        <p>More important changes happened during the transition from the mid fidelity to the high fidelity prototype. I had gained a better understanding of UX standards which resulted in the optimisation of features mainly by removing or adding
          wireframes to create more efficient and intuitive flows. The search flow, as well as sign up flow benefitted most from these changes and evolved into a smoother experience.</p>
        <h3>HIGH-FIDELITY</h3>

            <h3>GOALS</h3>
            <p>The goal was to test the usability of the web app by giving first time users basic tasks to fulfill. The results helped asses if the users understood how to complete the tasks and if they value the utility of the web app. Based on
              the knowledge gained I was able to recognise weaknesses that needed to be corrected.</p>

              <li>Find out if participants can easily locate the sign up function and is the sign up process understandable.</li>
              <li>Observe how quickly the participants can find information about aftercare. </li>

            <h3>METHODOLOGY</h3>
            <p>Moderated in-person and moderated remote usability tests, all of which were recorded. One half of the group of participants was given the desktop version to test first and the other half tested the mobile version first.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>After completing the usability tests it was time to make sense of all of the information I had collected. The first step was to create an affinity map to help me structure my findings. So many Post-its!!! I could then evaluate the
          severity of the issues I had discovered by entering them into a rainbow spreadsheet and rating them using the Jakob Nielsen‘s rating scale, as well adding up how many participants had the same issues.</p>

        </picture>
        <p>User testing helped me find the less obvious, sneakier issues that I was too close to to see. After analysing the spreadsheet I decided to prioritise the first 5 errors based on their impact and the time needed to correct them. It only
          took small changes to remove these issues, but the positive impact on the user experience was immense. Most surprising to me was that all volunteers had problems understanding my sign up/log in icon (lock icon). How did I not see this
          before? This step showed me very clearly how important it is to get a fresh set of eyes to look at my work.</p>

        <h2>REFINE</h2>
        <p>Adding content, applying visual design principles and putting together the style guide for InkTank led to aesthetic changes which created consistency throughout the wireframes.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Another important step was the feedback round with my peers. Their feedback helped me smoothen out some last issues, most specifically the sign up/log in button that was still causing problems. To finish off the iteration process I
          applied the accessibility guidelines which visually made InkTank more dynamic by tweaking the colour palette. But also made the web app more accessible in general.</p>

            <p>Two major things I learnt are that it's absolutely ok to be wrong and that if you listen closely and ask the right questions your users will very often give you the solution. Having your users disagree with your design choices during
              testing is a great opportunity to understand them better and learn. It is impossible to have thought everything through and often you need a fresh set of eyes to point out the obvious.</p>

                <li>I would like to flesh out the filter options by doing more research on what users look for in tattoos. This can be easily done by creating a survey.</li>
                <li>I would like to improve the main menu content. During my usability testing some users expressed that the organisation of its content and sub-content wasn’t completely obvious. By creating a card sort I should be able to learn
                  how
                  to
                  iterate the menu structure.</li>
                <li>I seems that two menus ( main menu + profile menu) are maybe too many and contain too much hidden information. I would like to try and integrate the content of the main menu in to the navigation tab as a horizontally scrollable
                  menu.
                  This would minimise the steps the user needs to take when changing categories. No need to open the menu every time and no more guessing what is hiding behind the hamburger menu. A/B testing and usability testing will help me
                  validate
                  my
                  hypothesis.</li>
